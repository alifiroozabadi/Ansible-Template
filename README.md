## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alifiroozabadi/Ansible-Template.git
```

## Prerequisites

Before using the Ansible template, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Ansible is installed on the control machine. If not, you can install it by following the official [Ansible Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html).

- Access to the target servers with SSH. Make sure you have the necessary SSH keys and credentials configured to connect to the servers.

## Usage

1. Edit the `inventory.ini` file and add the IP addresses or hostnames of the target servers under the appropriate groups. You can also specify additional variables for each server if needed.

2. Customize the `playbook.yml` file to define the software applications and their configurations you want to install. Use the Ansible modules and tasks to specify the desired installation steps.

3. Run the Ansible playbook to initiate the installation process:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
   ```

   Ansible will connect to the target servers and execute the tasks defined in the playbook to install the specified software applications.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the playbook according to your specific requirements. You can add or remove software applications, modify their configurations, and include additional tasks as needed. Refer to the Ansible documentation for a comprehensive list of available modules and their usage.
